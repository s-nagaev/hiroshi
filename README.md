Hiroshi is a [GPT4Free](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free)-based Telegram chatbot that offers 100% free access to 
interact with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama2 language models, inclusive of Bing, You, AI Chat, and more. Users have the 
freedom to select their preferred model or specific provider. Do note, the speed/stability may be slightly diminished 
when working with certain providers. Conversation context is fully retained when you switch between models and 
providers.

**Note:** This bot provides access to public free services. The quality and speed of such services can vary depending on 
various conditions and their current load. If you need a bot that uses the official OpenAI API and you have an API KEY, 
please check the following repository: https://github.com/s-nagaev/chibi.

## Supported platforms

- linux/amd64
- linux/arm64 *(Raspberry Pi 4+ is supported!)*

## Features

- Access to language models such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama2.
- Ability to choose a specific model or provider, with the fastest and most available provider automatically selected for the chosen model.
- Customizable storage time for conversation history.
- Preservation of conversation history even when changing providers or models.
- Pre-configured for quick setup, requiring only a Telegram bot token to get started.
- Cross-platform support (amd64, arm64).
- MIT License.

## Can I try it?

Sure! [@hiroshi_gpt_bot](https://t.me/hiroshi_gpt_bot)


## System Requirements

The application is not resource-demanding at all. It works perfectly on the minimal Raspberry Pi 4 and the cheapest AWS 
EC2 Instance `t4g.nano` (2 arm64 cores, 512MB RAM), while being able to serve many people simultaneously.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose (optional)

## Getting Started

### Using Docker Run

1. Pull the Hiroshi Docker image:

    ```shell
    docker pull pysergio/hiroshi:latest
    ```

2. Run the Docker container with the necessary environment variables:

    ```shell
    docker run -d \
      -e TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<your_telegram_token> \
      -v <path_to_local_data_directory>:/app/data \
      --name hiroshi \
      pysergio/hiroshi:latest
    ```
   Replace `<your_telegram_token>` and `<path_to_local_data_directory>` with appropriate values.

### Using Docker Compose

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following contents:

   ```yaml
      version: '3'

      services:
        hiroshi:
         restart: unless-stopped
         image: pysergio/hiroshi:latest
         environment:
           TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN: <your_telegram_token>
         volumes:
           - hiroshi_data:/app/data
      
      volumes:
        hiroshi_data:
   ```

   Replace `<your_telegram_token>` with appropriate values.

2. Run the Docker container:

   ```shell
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
