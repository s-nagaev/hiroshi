## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2024-02-25

### Added:
- Implemented chatbot behavior in group chats: Hiroshi, once added to a group chat, now maintains a unified 
conversation history and possesses a single context when communicating with chat participants within the group.
- Introduced GROUP_ADMINS setting, which allows the definition of chat-bot administrators in groups. Chat-bot 
administrators have exclusive permission to set the provider and execute the /reset command within the group.

### Fixed:
- Fixed an error that prevented the use of Redis for storing bot data (due to incompatibility with the previously 
used library with python 3.11).
